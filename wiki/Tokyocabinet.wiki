#summary Using Tokyo Cabinet as the backend.

= Introduction =

Tokyo Cabinet can be used to store more data in a Scalaris node than would fit into its main memory.

Note: you don't get [FAQ#Is_the_store_persisted_on_disk? persistence]!!! DB files are truncated on first access!!!

= Prerequisites =

You will need:
  * [http://fallabs.com/tokyocabinet/ Tokyo Cabinet]
  * [http://hg.opensource.lshift.net/toke/ toke]

= Switching to toke =

  # Install Tokyo Cabinet
  # Install/make toke, e.g. by installing an rpm, provided in our [FAQ#Prebuild_packages repositories])
  # Rerun configure with --enable-toke. configure assumes that you installed toke in your erlang's _lib_ directory, i.e. "`<erlang_dir`>/lib/toke" or "`<erlang_dir`>/lib/toke-`<version`>". If you used a different directory, e.g. /home/scalaris/apps/toke, you have to provide the path to configure:
{{{
./configure --enable-toke=/home/scalaris/apps/toke/
}}}
  # Switch the database in include/scalaris.hrl to db_toke
{{{
-define(DB, db_toke).
%-define(DB, db_ets).
}}}
  # recompile
{{{
make
}}}

The database files are currently stored in the data sub-directory. Each node creates its own sub-directory and each scalaris node will have a different file. The path can be changed in scalaris.cfg with the _db_directory_ option.
