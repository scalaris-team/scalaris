\section{Network}

\scalaris{} uses a couple of TCP ports for communication. It does
not use UDP at the moment.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
 & HTTP Server & Inter-node communication \\
\midrule
default (see \code{bin/scalaris.cfg})                 & $8000$    & $14195$--$14198$ \\
first node (\code{bin/firstnode.sh})                  & $8000$    & $14195$          \\
joining node 1 (\code{bin/joining_node.sh})           & $8001$    & $14196$          \\
other joining nodes (\code{bin/joining_node.sh <ID>}) & $8000+\texttt{<ID>}$ & $14195+\texttt{<ID>}$ \\
standalone mgmt server (\code{bin/mgmt-server.sh})    & $7999$    & $14194$          \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Please make sure that at least 14195 and 14196 are not blocked by
firewalls in order to be able to start at least one first and one joining node
on each machine..
