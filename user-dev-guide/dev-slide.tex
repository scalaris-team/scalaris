\chapter{How data is transferred (atomically)}
\label{chapter.slide}

A data transfer from a node to one of its (two) neighbours is also called a
\emph{slide}. A slide operation is defined in the \erlmodule{slide\_op} module,
the protocol is mainly implemented in \erlmodule{dht\_node\_move}.
Parts of the slide are dependent on the ring maintenance implementation and are
split off into modules implementing the \erlmodule{slide\_beh} behaviour.

Though the protocols are mainly symmetric, we distinguish between sending data
to the predecessor and sending data to the successor, respectively. In the
following protocol visualisations, arrows denote message exchanges, pseudo-code
for operations that are being executed is put at the side of each time bar.
Functions in green are those implemented in the \erlmodule{slide\_beh}
behaviour, if annotated with an arrow pointing to itself, this callback is
asynchronous.
During the protocol, the slide operation goes through several phases which are
show in black boxes.

In general, a slide consists of three steps:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item set up slide
 \item send data \& start recording changes, i.e. delta
 \item send delta \& transfer responsibility
\end{enumerate}

The latter two may be repeated to execute incremental slides which further
reduce periods of unavailability. During this period, no node is responsible
for the range to transfer and messages are thus delayed until the receiving
node gains responsibility.
